## About

Yew is a modern Rust framework for creating multi-threaded front-end web apps with WebAssembly.

Features a macro for declaring interactive HTML with Rust expressions. Developers who have experience using JSX in React should feel quite at home when using Yew.
Achieves high performance by minimizing DOM API calls for each page render and by making it easy to offload processing to background web workers.
Supports JavaScript interoperability, allowing developers to leverage NPM packages and integrate with existing JavaScript applications.
Note: Yew is not 1.0 yet. Be prepared to do major refactoring due to breaking API changes
